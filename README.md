### Why does this exist?

Wait you're asking me? I have no clue, I just felt like making Pong without `<canvas>` and here we are. I also just felt like making "some" project, and this was "something", which is why this project exists...

### What's missing

 * More pride color schemes
   - Feel free to make a PR adding it in the `src/prides.json` file, and please sort it alphabetically, I beg you.
 * Better collision detection
 * Other minor bugs/features
   - Window resize handling
   - Date based pride schemes
   - And more....

### Controls

<kbd>W</kbd><kbd>S</kbd>: to move player one<br>
<kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd>: to move player two
